### Hi there, I'm Jessi 👋

![Ime_for_gitHUb](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99251460/187037405-b79c7b75-f6d8-4306-b1db-3238acde85b2.jpeg)

I'm a Software Developer from Bremen/ Germany, I've quitted my last Job right before pandemic start, had some health issues and I'm now on my way back at the moment I'm doing an further education for mobile app development at Syntax Institut.

Formerly I was an crm Developer especially Dynamics 365. But I needed a change...

In the android module I've made the decision to go on my own with Jetpack Compose for my app idea instead of xml-view.

In the Swift module I#ve made the decision to go with SwiftUI.

Now I'm open for jobs as mobile app dev. My further education ended in December'22 but for sure I'm still learning and won't stop doing it. That's my Nature

And I'm looking for a new Job as mobile app dev at the moment !!! Feel free to reach me

I'm interested in Swift, iOS, Android, Kotlin, TDD, Cleancode.....

and I'm totally in love with the new declarative frameworks as Compose in Android and SwiftUI in iOS

Feel free to reach me



- 🌱 I’m currently working on new Project Ideas at the momeent in design pocess. I'm going deeper in the declarative frameworks and focussing at the moment on SwiftUI. But the new project won't be public but for sure I give access for applications feel free to reach me. You're welcome
