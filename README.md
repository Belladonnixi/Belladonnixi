### Hi there, I'm Jessi 👋

I'm a Software Developer from Bremen/ Germany, I've quitted my last Job right before pandemic start, had some health issues and I'm now on my way back at the moment I'm doing an further education for mobile app development at Syntax Institut.

Formerly I was an crm Developer especially Dynamics 365. But I needed a change...

In the android module I've made the decision to go on my own with Jetpack Compose for my app idea instead of xml-view.

Now learning iOS Development with Swift....

##And I'm looking for a new Job as mobile app dev at the moment !!! Feel free to reach me

I'm interested in Swift, iOS, Android, Kotlin, TDD, Cleancode.....

Feel free to reach me
